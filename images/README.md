# Image Asset Organization

The image library is organized by content type so pages can reference stable, descriptive paths.

## Current directories

- `ship/` for ship-wide exterior and deck visuals
- `venues/` for onboard venue, dining, and activity visuals
- `ports/` for destination-specific visuals
- `rccl-press/` for attribution/source metadata

Placeholder card/thumb assets were removed so the library now contains only active imagery used by the site.
