3. Ship Fundamentals & Daily Rhythm
3.1 Your Ship Geography
Deck 6 Aft (6650, 6651): “The Quiet Zone. ”  
  Optimal for quick elevator access to Dining Rooms (Decks 3-5) and Windjammer (Deck 11). Use aft 
stairwell/elevators as your primary vertical artery.
Deck 8 Forward-Mid (8528): “The Central Hub. ”  
  Closer to forward entertainment (Theater, Spa). Use forward stairwell/elevators. Ideal meeting 
point: R Bar on Deck 5 Promenade.
3.2 The Non-Negotiable Daily Beat
Morning (7:30-9:00 AM):  
===== PAGE 6 =====
–
–
–
–
–
–
–––
–
–
–
–
Morning (7:30-9:00 AM):  
  Light breakfast (Café Promenade) or full buffet (Windjammer). Confirm day’s plan via group chat.
Late Morning (10:00 AM):  
  Execute the chosen “Path” for the day (Adventure, Culture, or Chill).
Afternoon (1:00-4:00 PM):  
  Lunch, followed by flexible time (pool, trivia, nap, return from port).
Pre-Dinner (6:45 PM):  
  Mandatory Group Meet-Up at R Bar. Dress for dinner, coordinate evening plans.
Evening (7:30 PM+):  
  Dinner, followed by show, music, or leisure.
Night (10:00 PM+):  
  Optional late-night activities (comedy, dancing, snacks).
3.3 Entertainment & Booking Truths
Myth: Shows must be booked months in advance.
Reality on Adventure of the Seas: Main theater and ice shows are first-come, first-served.
Strategy: The Ice Show in Studio B is the priority. Check the app for performance days 
(typically sea days). Arrive 30 minutes early for the best group seating. For main theater 
shows, arriving 15-20 minutes early is sufficient.

5. Port Playbook: Tactical Briefs
5.1 Grand Cayman (Tender Port)
Tender Process: Tenders begin ≈10:45 AM. Go early (10:15 AM) or expect tickets/lines. Ship 
excursions meet first.
Return: Last tender is at 5:15 PM. Aim to queue by 4:30 PM.
Currency: USD widely accepted. Many places take credit cards.
5.2 Falmouth, Jamaica
Docking: Ship docks. Easy walk-off.
Advice: For independent tours, only use licensed operators inside the port gate. Set a clear 
price and return time.
Must-Try: Jerk chicken from “Scotchies” (located just outside port).
5.3 Perfect Day at CocoCay
#1 Rule: Disembark by 8:00 AM to claim prime lounge chairs.

Grill), Snack Shacks.

6. Dining & Speciality Restaurant Strategy
6.1 The 3-Night Package Execution
Bookings: Made and linked on Embarkation Day.
Recommended Nights: Day 1 (avoid MDR chaos), Day 3 (post-Grand Cayman), Day 6 
(CocoCay celebration).
Venue Guide:
Chops Grille: Classic steakhouse. Order the filet and shareable sides.
Giovanni’s Table: Italian family-style. Perfect for groups.
Izumi: Hibachi experience (entertaining) or à la carte sushi. Credit from package

applies.
6.2 Main Dining Room & other Venues
My Time Dining: You have reservations. Show up at your set time each night.
Windjammer (Buffet): Best for breakfast variety and casual lunches. Avoid peak times (8:30 
AM, 12:30 PM).
Café Promenade: 24/7 included snacks (pizza, sandwiches, cookies). Your late-night savior.
---
7. Finance, Communication & Logistics
7.1 The Financial Control Panel
SeaPass: Your onboard credit card. All spending is charged to your cabin account.
Tracking: Use the “Onboard Account” feature in the Royal app daily to monitor charges.
Gratuities: Standard daily gratuity ($18.50+/person/day) will be auto-charged. You pre-paid 
or will see this on your final bill.
Settling Up: Final bill is charged to the card on file early on debarkation day. Review paper 
statement left at your cabin.
7.2 The Communication Matrix
Onboard (Primary): Royal App’s free in-app chat. Works over ship Wi-Fi without an internet 
package. Create a group for all 6 guests.
Onboard (Secondary - External): The 1-device VOOM internet plan. Use for WhatsApp, 
email, social media. Log in/out as needed on shared devices.
In Port: Local cell service may work (check your plan). Use WhatsApp if connected. Always 
set a clear physical meet-up time and place.
7.3 Luggage & Packing
Embarkation: Attach tags. Check large bags with porters; keep essentials, meds, swimwear, 
and documents in carry-on.
Debarkation: Place large bags outside your cabin by 11:00 PM on final night. Keep 
debarkation day clothes and toiletries in carry-on.

8. Debarkation & Return to Reality
8.1 The Night Before (Day 6)
Pack checked luggage.
Settle onboard account (visit Guest Services if discrepancies).
Place luggage in hallway by 11:00 PM.
8.2 Debarkation Morning (Day 7)
Early Breakfast: Windjammer or Café Promenade opens early.
Two Disembarkation Options:
Self-Assist (Recommended for Control): Keep all luggage, walk off once ship clears 
(≈7:15 AM). Best for those with early travel.
Checked Luggage: Wait in a designated lounge for your luggage tag number/color to 
be called. Disembark, find bags in terminal.
Customs: Use facial recognition or present passport. Proceed to transportation.
8.3 Post-Cruise
Survey: You may receive a guest satisfaction survey via email. Your feedback matters.
Memories: Your SeaPass cards are souvenirs. Photos can be purchased or downloaded if you 
used the ship’s photographers.

Final Transmission

reality of your family’s adventure. Trust the plan, then live beyond it.
Bon Voyage, family and friends.

ADDENDUM X — FAILURE MODES, CONTINGENCIES & 
FORCE MULTIPLIERS
===== PAGE 11 =====
Companion to The Family and Friends Cruise Companion: Unabridged Operations 
Manual
Purpose:
This addendum exists for the moments between the plan and reality. It covers health, weather, kids, 
fatigue, human error, and ship quirks — the things that actually cause stress if they aren’t pre-
decided.
Read once. Use rarely. Appreciate silently.
⸻
X1) MEDICAL & HEALTH CONTINGENCY PROTOCOL
Medical Center (Know Before You Need It)
Location: Deck 4 (forward)
Hours: Posted daily in app; 24-hour emergency availability
Cost reality: Care is not free. Charges go to SeaPass.
Decision Tree
Minor issue (headache, nausea, scrape):
→ Treat in cabin first → reassess in 30–60 minutes
Moderate issue (fever, persistent vomiting, allergic reaction):
→ One adult escorts to Medical
→ One adult remains with kids
→ Concierge notified
Serious issue (injury, breathing trouble):
→ Call ship emergency number immediately (posted on cabin phone)
Medication Safeguard
  • All critical meds must be split across two carry-ons, not one bag.
  • Never leave all meds in one cabin.
⸻
===== PAGE 12 =====
X2) WEATHER & SEA-STATE ADAPTATION LOGIC
If CocoCay Is Windy or Overcast
  • Shade > chairs > water
  • Poolside + Snack Shack beats beach frustration
  • Accept “half-day win” and leave early if conditions turn
If Tendering Is Delayed (Grand Cayman)
  • Ship excursions go first — this is intentional
  • Independent plans should not rush
  • Convert morning plan → afternoon plan without negotiation
